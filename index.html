   <header>Why Photography?</header>

   <p id="p2">Photography.Beautiful,is it not? It often has a way of eliciting an emotional reaction from people, similar to the way music does. Because of this, I took a keen interest in photography, aiming to elicit the same reactions from people as well as express myself in the best way I thought possible. </p>

   <h2>Inspiration: Annie Leibovitz</h2>

    <p id="p1">Annie Leibovitz manages to <strong>capture the essence of the people and objects around her</strong> and depict it in an amazing way.This inspired me to venture into photography,capturing details that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.</p>

   <h2>Personal Favourites.</h2>

   <p>I find photography to be a <em>very soothing mode of expression</em>.This collection is a reflection of how I see the world: sometimes simple, sometimes imperfect, always honest. Each photograph holds a moment I wanted to remember or a feeling I wanted to preserve. I hope these images invite you to slow down, look closer, and find something familiar or inspiring in them.</p>
